================================================================================
ANNEX J — DERIVATIVE WORKS & FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENCE TEST (ENFORCEMENT STANDARD)
================================================================================

J.1 PURPOSE
This Annex provides objective tests for determining whether a work is a Derivative Work, a Reimplementation,
or a Competitive Product under Sections 1, 5, and 12.

J.2 FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENCE (GATE-AND-OUTPUT TEST)
A system is deemed Functionally Equivalent if it substantially reproduces any TWO OR MORE of the following:
(a) Evidence-gated output delivery (no conclusion without validation / mandatory gate behavior);
(b) Fail-closed behavior on missing/invalid evidence or temporal uncertainty;
(c) Decision graph semantics (nodes/edges/validity constraints) used to structure outputs;
(d) Token trust chain (input/evidence/graph hashing + signature or equivalent reproducibility proof);
(e) Constitution-style constraint enforcement (rules that reject or constrain outputs at runtime);
(f) Multi-expert routing/consensus mechanism functionally similar to Leader Swarm.

J.3 ARCHITECTURE EXTRACTION (RECONSTRUCTABILITY TEST)
Content constitutes Architecture Extraction if it enables a reasonably skilled engineer to reproduce:
(a) the FSM gate order, (b) the evidence pipeline stages, (c) the graph semantics,
(d) the token chain, or (e) the DSL enforcement flow—whether via prose, diagrams, tables, pseudo-code,
or step-by-step guides.

J.4 SUBSTANTIAL SIMILARITY (STRUCTURE-AND-FLOW TEST)
Substantial Similarity exists where the overall structure, flow, and enforcement gates are materially similar,
even if names, frameworks, or implementation languages differ.

J.5 INTENT IS IRRELEVANT
Good faith, “inspiration,” “clean-room,” or “educational use” does not negate breach where the result meets
J.2–J.4.

J.6 BURDEN OF CLARITY
If You are uncertain whether a use is prohibited, You must treat it as prohibited unless Written Permission
is obtained in advance.

================================================================================
ANNEX K — OUTPUT CLASSIFICATION & HANDLING (RESTRICTED OUTPUT POLICY)
================================================================================

K.1 RESTRICTED OUTPUT
All Outputs are deemed “Restricted Output” unless explicitly designated otherwise in writing.

K.2 NO PUBLICATION / NO SHARING
Restricted Output may not be published, posted, uploaded, pasted, emailed to third parties, or shared in any
public or private forum, including issue trackers, chat rooms, wikis, ticketing systems, or knowledge bases.

K.3 NO DATASETIFICATION
Restricted Output may not be transformed into datasets, labels, rubrics, examples, benchmarks, “gold answers,”
prompt libraries, or evaluation harnesses for any system.

K.4 NO RETRIEVAL STORAGE
Restricted Output may not be stored in any retrieval system, including vector databases, embeddings stores,
search indexes, “memory” features, long-term logs, or any system designed to recall or reconstruct content.

K.5 MINIMUM NECESSARY BUG REPORTING
Bug reports may include only Minimum Necessary Disclosure. You must redact implementation-reconstructable details,
including full state flows, rule tables, and reproducible token chain parameters.

K.6 AUTOMATIC DELETION RECOMMENDATION
You should delete Restricted Output promptly after evaluation. Upon termination, deletion is mandatory.

================================================================================
ANNEX L — FEEDBACK & CONTRIBUTIONS (NO OBLIGATION; LICENSE TO FEEDBACK)
================================================================================

L.1 NO OBLIGATION
The Copyright Holder has no obligation to use, implement, or respond to Feedback or Contributions.

L.2 LICENSE TO FEEDBACK (DEFENSIVE)
To the maximum extent permitted by law, You grant the Copyright Holder a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable,
royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, publish, distribute, and
commercialize any Feedback, suggestions, or ideas You provide, without compensation or attribution.

L.3 NO TRANSFER OF YOUR SEPARATE IP
This Annex does not transfer Your pre-existing intellectual property unrelated to the Software.

================================================================================
ANNEX M — LIQUIDATED DAMAGES (OPTIONAL; SUBJECT TO LEGAL LIMITS)
================================================================================

M.1 ACKNOWLEDGMENT
You acknowledge that breaches involving AI Training Use, Indexing, RAG, redistribution, or competitive use
cause harm that is difficult to quantify, including loss of trade secret value and loss of exclusivity.

M.2 LIQUIDATED DAMAGES (REASONABLE ESTIMATE)
Where permitted by law, You agree to pay liquidated damages as a reasonable pre-estimate of harm:
(a) For AI Training Use, Indexing, embeddings, or RAG corpus creation: an amount equal to the greater of
    (i) direct profits attributable to the breach, or (ii) a reasonable commercial license fee that would
    have been charged for such use, multiplied by a factor of 3.
(b) For redistribution/mirroring/hosting to third parties: the greater of
    (i) direct profits attributable to the breach, or (ii) a reasonable commercial license fee, multiplied by 2.
(c) For competitive-use breaches: the greater of
    (i) direct profits attributable to the breach, or (ii) a reasonable commercial license fee, multiplied by 4.

M.3 COURT ADJUSTMENT
If a court finds any amount excessive, the amount shall be reduced to the maximum enforceable level that
still reflects the Copyright Holder’s protective intent.

================================================================================
ANNEX N — MARKS, PRESS, AND BRAND CONTROL
================================================================================

N.1 NO MARKS LICENSE
No rights are granted to use the Marks. You may not use names, logos, taglines, or branding in any manner
that suggests endorsement, partnership, certification, or official affiliation.

N.2 NO PRESS / NO PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS
You may not publish press releases, marketing materials, or public statements about any evaluation results
without Written Permission.

N.3 NO CONFUSION
You may not register domains, social accounts, or identifiers confusingly similar to the Marks.

END OF LICENSE
