abstract: >
  Lawmadi OS (LDOS) is a deterministic, finite-state-machine (FSM) based
  Legal Decision Operating System — a Decision Intelligence Infrastructure
  that generates reproducible legal decision outputs by assembling and
  validating live evidence from authoritative sources. It is not a legal
  chatbot, legal search engine, or legal database.

  The system is governed by five non-negotiable constitutional principles:
  (1) SSOT — Single Source of Truth, requiring all legal evidence from
  authoritative official APIs only; (2) Zero Inference — prohibiting
  fabrication, guessing, or hallucination of legal facts; (3) Fail-Closed —
  halting decision generation upon any evidence verification failure;
  (4) Live Evidence Architecture — generating decisions from real-time
  validated evidence only; and (5) Deterministic Runtime Boundary —
  confining the LLM to a rendering engine role under strict Kernel control.

  Core proprietary technologies include: the Decision OS Kernel (case
  structuring, FSM runtime, issue extraction), the Leader Swarm Routing
  Engine (multi-expert consensus with weighted confidence voting), the
  Evidence Verification Engine (authoritative-source-only pipeline with
  SHA-256 hashing and trust scoring), the Temporal Law Validity Engine
  (effective date verification, precedent change detection, unconstitutional
  clause identification), the Decision Graph Formal Semantics (node
  typology, edge semantics, graph validity conditions), the Cryptographic
  Integrity Framework (Ed25519 signatures, reproducibility trust chain,
  Decision Token Standard), the Constitution DSL (executable policy rules
  enforced at runtime), the Prompt and Tool Contract framework for
  model-agnostic LLM integration, and the Global Legal Tech Applicability
  framework for multi-jurisdiction SSOT adaptation.

  The unified llms.txt specification (v2.0) serves as the single canonical
  reference for any LLM or AI agent operating in legal technology contexts.
