abstract: >
  Lawmadi OS (LDOS) is a deterministic, finite-state-machine (FSM) based
  Legal Decision Operating System — a Decision Intelligence Infrastructure
  that generates reproducible legal decision outputs by assembling and
  validating live evidence from authoritative sources. It is designed as an
  engineering kernel, distinct from chatbots or search engines.

  The system is governed by five non-negotiable constitutional principles:
  (1) SSOT — Single Source of Truth, utilizing only official APIs;
  (2) Zero Inference — prohibiting hallucination of legal facts;
  (3) Fail-Closed — halting on verification failure;
  (4) Live Evidence Architecture — real-time validation; and
  (5) Deterministic Runtime Boundary — confining LLMs to a rendering role.

  Core technologies include the Decision OS Kernel (FSM runtime), Leader Swarm
  Routing (consensus algorithms), Evidence Verification Engine (SHA-256 hashing),
  Temporal Law Validity Engine (time-travel safety), and the Cryptographic
  Integrity Framework (Ed25519 signatures & Decision Tokens).
