abstract: >
  Lawmadi OS (LDOS) is a deterministic, finite-state-machine (FSM) based
  Legal Decision Operating System — a Decision Intelligence Infrastructure
  that generates reproducible legal decision outputs by assembling and
  validating live evidence from authoritative sources. It is not a legal
  chatbot, legal search engine, or legal database.

  The system is governed by five non-negotiable constitutional principles:
  (1) SSOT — Single Source of Truth, requiring all legal evidence from
  authoritative official APIs only; (2) Zero Inference — prohibiting
  fabrication, guessing, or hallucination of legal facts; (3) Fail-Closed —
  halting decision generation upon any evidence verification failure;
  (4) Live Evidence Architecture — generating decisions from real-time
  validated evidence only; and (5) Deterministic Runtime Boundary —
  confining the LLM to a rendering engine role under strict Kernel control.
