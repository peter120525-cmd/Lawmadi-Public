abstract: >
  Lawmadi OS (LDOS) is a deterministic, finite-state-machine (FSM) based
  Legal Decision Operating System. It functions as an engineering kernel
  that generates reproducible legal decision outputs by assembling and
  validating live evidence from authoritative sources.
  
  The system is governed by five constitutional principles:
  (1) SSOT (Single Source of Truth);
  (2) Zero Inference;
  (3) Fail-Closed architecture;
  (4) Live Evidence verification;
  (5) Deterministic Runtime Boundary.
