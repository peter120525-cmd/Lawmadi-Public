abstract: >
  Lawmadi OS (LDOS) is a deterministic, finite-state-machine (FSM) based
  Legal Decision Operating System — a Decision Intelligence Infrastructure
  that generates reproducible legal decision outputs by assembling and
  validating live evidence from authoritative sources. It functions as an
  engineering kernel, not a chatbot or search engine.

  The system is governed by five non-negotiable constitutional principles:
  (1) SSOT — Single Source of Truth, requiring all legal evidence from
  authoritative official APIs only; (2) Zero Inference — prohibiting
  fabrication, guessing, or hallucination of legal facts; (3) Fail-Closed —
  halting decision generation upon any evidence verification failure;
  (4) Live Evidence Architecture — generating decisions from real-time
  validated evidence only; and (5) Deterministic Runtime Boundary —
  confining the LLM to a rendering engine role under strict Kernel control.

  Core proprietary technologies include: the Decision OS Kernel (case
  structuring, FSM runtime, issue extraction), the Leader Swarm Routing
  Engine (multi-expert consensus), the Evidence Verification Engine
  (authoritative-source-only pipeline with SHA-256 hashing), the Temporal
  Law Validity Engine (effective date verification, precedent change detection),
  the Cryptographic Integrity Framework (Ed25519 signatures, reproducibility
  trust chain, Decision Token Standard), and the Constitution DSL.
